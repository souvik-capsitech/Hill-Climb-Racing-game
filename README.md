## Description
This project aims to recreate the core addictive gameplay experience of Hill Climb Racing, where a player must navigate a vehicle through treacherous, procedurally generated or handmade terrains, utilizing realistic (often "wonky") 2D physics to maintain balance and reach the finish line. The primary goal is usually to travel as far as possible, collecting coins and fuel along the way, without running out of fuel or flipping the vehicle.

## Features
*   **Realistic/Fun 2D Physics:** Custom physics simulation to handle vehicle balance and terrain interaction.
*   **Vehicle System:** Different vehicles with unique attributes and upgradable parts (e.g., engine, suspension, tires).
*   **Procedural or Handmade Levels:** Varied environments and obstacles like rocks, ramps, and cliffs.
*   **Collectibles:** In-game coins and fuel cans to extend the run and facilitate upgrades.
*   **Immersive Sound Effects:** Engine sounds, collision effects, and background music.
*   **User Interface:** Intuitive UI for navigation, upgrades, and in-game information (speed, distance, fuel).

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the **Unity Game Engine** for development and **C#** for scripting.

## Getting Started
To run the project, you will need **Unity Hub** and a compatible version of the **Unity Editor**. Instructions for cloning the repository and opening the project in Unity are typically provided, along with steps on how to navigate to the main scene and start the game by pressing the **Play** button.

## How to Play
Controls typically involve an **accelerator** and **brake/reverse**. The objective is to drive as far as possible without running out of fuel or flipping the car. Tips for playing often suggest using small taps on the controls to maintain balance, especially during jumps and climbs.

## Contributing
Information on contributing to the project is often included. This typically involves forking the repository, creating a feature branch, committing changes, pushing to the branch, and opening a pull request.

## License
The project is usually distributed under a specific license, such as the **MIT License**. The details can be found in the `LICENSE` file.
# Development Branch Test
This line was added to test the dev branch.
